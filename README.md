# Kaggle
This is the repository where I uploaded the solution codes I developed for Kaggle competitions.

This repository contains multiple branches, each incorporating the name of the related competition in its name.

## Precautions
This repository includes code that was fully developed by me or my team, as well as code that was partially based on publicly available notebooks. Given the nature of Kaggle competitions, using shared resources can sometimes be more advantageous. Please keep this in mind when reviewing the code.
