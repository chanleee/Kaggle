# Kaggle
This is the repository where I uploaded the solution codes I developed for Kaggle competitions.
This repository contains multiple branches, each incorporating the name of the related competition in its name.

## Precautions

This repository contains code that has been developed by me or our team from start to finish, as well as code that has not. (This is because, given the nature of Kaggle competitions, there are instances where it is more beneficial to utilize code shared as public notebooks.) Please bear this in mind when reviewing the code.
